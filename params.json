  "body": "### Project Overview\r\nThis is the week 4 project for the data science practical machine learning course.  Per the request in the assignment, gh-pages were created for the repo.  An HTML page was knitted, and the RMD was uploaded to the repo as well.  You can download all files in the repo, or go directly to the repo by clicking on the links in the left.  Note: if you go to the Github repo and click the html file, you will only see the raw html code - not a rendered web page.  If all you want to see is the html file, as a rendered web page, click here:\r\n\r\nhttp://study-lsc.github.io/ml-week4-project.html\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
